# Hole

A hole represents the context in which a Go expression is being evaluated during escape analysis. It essentially tells us where the result of evaluating an expression will flow and under what transformations.

For example, consider the expression:

```go
x = **p
```

When analyzing `p` in this expression, the hole would carry the information that:
- The destination (dst) is `x`.
- The number of dereferences (`derefs`) applied is 2

This notion allows the compiler to track how values are propagated, dereferenced, and possibly escape their local scope. Importantly, any location can be converted into a hole, making it a general-purpose construct for reasoning about evaluation contexts.

The structure of a hole in Go escape analysis is defined as follows:

```go
type hole struct {
	dst    *location
	derefs int // >= -1
	notes  *note
	addrtaken bool
}
```

### dst

The destination where the evaluated value is intended to go. It represents the abstract memory location (such as a variable, parameter, or heap object) into which the expressionâ€™s result will be placed.

### derefs
The number of pointer dereference operations that should be applied to reach the destination. A value of 0 means the expression result is stored directly into dst. A positive value n means the result is dereferenced n times (e.g., `**p` has `derefs = 2`). A value of -1 is a special case, often used to indicate that the expression result is discarded (i.e., evaluation happens but the result is not stored).

### addrtaken

Indicates whether the address of the expression is being taken in this context, regardless of whether that address will eventually be stored in a variable. This flag is important because simply taking the address of a variable may cause it to escape, even if the address is not ultimately used elsewhere.
